# Tower Defense Online

__Introduction__

This game is unlike the traditional Tower Defense games. It is a multiplayer game where you can compete with your friends as either the attacker or the defender. Do not let its simple design fool you as strategy and wits is integral to excel in this game!

__How To play__

This game is designed to be played by 2 people competitively. Once a player starts finding match, he will be matched by the next player that finds match. The first player to queue will be able to choose his/her role(attacker or defender).

The attacker can create roads that connect the starting point to the endpoint while as the defender can create blockages(on which roads cannot be constructed) and towers on top of the blockages. The attacker's objective is to create the simplest path for the creeps to reach the end point so as most amount of creeps will leak. The defender's objective is to make the creeps path as complicated as possible so as to be able to place more efficient towers to prevent as many creep leaks as possible.

The game can only be started after the road is connected from the starting point to the end point. Once the game starts, the creeps will spawn.
